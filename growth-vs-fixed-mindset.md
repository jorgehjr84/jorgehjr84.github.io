#There’s Hope For All of Us 


I have heard of the terms Nature vs Nuture, and what I have always gathered is that the science community is still debating heavily on whether the premise of each of these arguments is true. In this essay I will be going over Growth vs Fixed Mindsets. A theory developed by Dr.Carol Dweck. She has come up with the theory that intelligence is something that can be grown in individuals. Growing up as kids we have always heard “you are so smart,” whether it be from an adult telling you or another child. it is just something that was instilled in our brains. Some people were just smart. Dr. Carol Dweck says that’s not the case.


We will start out with Fixed Mindset. Fixed Mindset is the idea that someone is just born smart. It’s what we all grew up thinking. Some people are just smarter than others. People just think that they are born with their talents. They spend their time thinking about their success, instead of trying to further develop it. In one study performed by Dr. Dweck, she gives elementary students a difficult test to take. When they are finished she tells them “ You did so good, you are smart.” Then she gave them the option to take another difficult test, which they end up turning down. It may be for fear that they will under perform, or not meet the high standards they believe have been set for themselves.


Now we will talk about the Growth Mindset. When I heard about it, it intrigued me a lot, because it goes against what we have always been lead to believe. It is interesting because the theory behind the Growth Mindset is that intelligence and talent can be developed. People aren’t smarter than you because they were born that way, they just worked harder to get there. It’s such an inspiring concept and one that is gaining traction. In the study I mentioned earlier Dr. Dweck gives the same difficult test to other elementary students, however she tells the students at the end of the test “you did so well, you must have worked really hard.” This short phrase at the end of her statement had an incredible impact on the students. When she offered the students to take another difficult test, of the students she made the comment “ .. you must have worked really hard,”  90 percent of them were willing to take another difficult test. Incredible how something that seems so small can have such an impact on the way we learn.


When I started researching Dr. Dweck’s studies, it reminded me of a book I read not to long ago named “Outliers.” The author is Malcom Gladwell, and his book Outliers can be said to draw the same conclusions as Dr. Dweck. According to Malcolm Gladwell, geniuses aren’t born, they are made. He argues they are made through hard work and certain circumstances.  Gladwell even goes as far as to put a number on what makes someone a genius/expert at something. He says it takes about 10,000hrs to master a skill. Whether that skill be playing piano, mathematics, or even playing basketball. It is an extremely interesting theory, and is
extremely compelling stuff in my opinion, especially as a new parent. 


So just to recap, Growth Mindset is when you feel that intelligence, skill, talent, is something that can be developed through hard work and practice. It makes that argument that praising the work ethic and input is much more important than praising the achievement. Studies have also shown that when you praise the hard work, results are better. While Fixed Mindset is the theory that someone is born with a talent or intelligence level. This is the most common way I have thought of intelligence. I think its awesome that with studies like Dr. Dwecks, there is actually hope for all of us out there to be geniuses. It’s extremely encouraging.
