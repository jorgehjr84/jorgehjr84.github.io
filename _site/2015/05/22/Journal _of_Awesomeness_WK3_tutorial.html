<h2 id="objects">Objects</h2>

<p>In javascript we love using something called variables. A variable is a way to store information, and then call on 
information at a later time. For example  I would do this…..</p>

<p><code>
var myCity = " My Home town is Bronx,NY";
</code></p>

<p>So if I wanted to see what my hometown was, all I would have to type is 
<code>
console.log(myCity); 
</code>
and it would print out all of the info…. “ My Home town is Bronx,NY”</p>

<p>This is really cool, but what if I had a lot of information about myself that I wanted to be able to call upon fairly easily. This is where objects come in. Think of an almost like a cup. It has multiple elements for lack of a better word. A cup has a shape, a color, a size, etc…. So can objects. So an example of an object would be as follows…</p>

<p>```
    var jorge = {
    age: 31,
    hometown: “Bronx NY”,
    Kids:1
    Married: “Yes”</p>

<p>};
```</p>

<p>Now if we wanted to call on something we could do this….
<code>
console.log("Jorge is from the" + jorge.hometown);
</code></p>

<p>This will return “Jorge is from the Bronx NY”</p>

<p>And thats objects!!!!</p>
