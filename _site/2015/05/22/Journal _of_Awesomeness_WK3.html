<h2 id="week-3">Week 3</h2>

<p>Week 3 has been by far the most difficult week at TIY for me. Week 1 we were so excited to get started and week 2 we were just 
glad to get out of week 1. With that being said I feel like week 3 was the week I really started running out of steam. Everything 
felt like it was amplified by week 3. I had tons of questions… “am I falling behind, am I retaining enough, what we will be doing for the next few weeks, did I study enough.” It was draining. Luckily we had a short week due to a conference in St Pete and Memorial Day. It felt like a nice chance to recharge. I actually thought “am I studying enough” over the long weekend, until I looked back at how many hours I actually put in.</p>

<p>Going to the conference was a great experience. The very first night 
there was a mixer hosted at TIY St Pete, so I took it as an opportunity to network. First, everyone was so humble, even the big 
shots. Second, they were so welcoming to us, which was awesome considering some of these people have been coding for decades, 
where as I have been doing it for 3 weeks. It reassured me that I made the right decision to join this new world of developers.
The sense of community is awesome and I can’t wait to be fully emerged in it on a day to day basis. The conference had some excellent speakers with some really good snacks (chocolate covered bacon) and it was in a cool city. So all in all it was awesome. I actually can’t wait until next year’s conf. There were tons of topics that were brought up, and it was really a great chance to catch a glimpse of the industry I now belong to.</p>
