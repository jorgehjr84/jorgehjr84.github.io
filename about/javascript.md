## JavaScript Basics

### Literal Types

    Null - This basically means no object value is present.
    Boolen - A boolen is data that can only be "True" or "False"
    Number - Number is a numeric data type.
    String - A string is characters used to represent text.


###Special Constants

    Infinity - This is the numeric value that represents infinity.
    Nan - this is numeric data which is undefined or a value that cannot be represented.
    Undefined - A variable which has not been assigned a value.

###Basic Operators

    `+` This is the addition operator for adding numeric values
    `-`This is the subtraction operator for subtraction numeric values.
    `/` This is the division operator used to divide numeric values.
    `*` This multiplies two values.
    `()` This is parenthesis and is computed first due to the order of operations.
    '===' This is the equality operator. It also has an 'EVIL Twin' in ==. The difference between the two is that '==='  does the same as '==' except no type conversion is done.
    ex - "abc" == new String("abc")    // true
         "abc" === new String("abc")   // false
         Best practice is to use '==='

###More JavaScript!! :grimacing:

    variables - A variable is a named location where you can store value. That way you don't always have to type long lines of code.+ ex. var myName = Jorge; 
    Functions -  A function is a procedure that calculates value or performs a task.
    

    For Loops - This is an easy way to keep repeating something. Instead of typing the same code over and over, you can just put it in a loop.
    For Loop - This is a loop that keeps repeating until a value is False.
    While Loop - This is a cleaner way of writing a loop. Below is an example of a for loop and a while loop
    - for (var i; i < 10; i++);
    - while ( i < 10)


    if Else Statements - This lets you perform a task IF the statement is TRUE, if the statement is not true (else) perform task B.
    

    Arrays - An array is an ordered collection of data. 
    For example var myFriends [John, Joseph, Paul];
    Now to call out Joseph I would type
    text(myFriends[1]);
    

    Objects - An object is a standalone entity, with traits or properties so to speak.
    For example I can type
     var myHouse = newObject();
     myHouse.color = Green;
     myHouse.size = 1900';
     myHouse.bdrs = 4;
     
     In the JavaScript guide it gives the anaology of a cup to objects. A cup can have a color, shape, size, etc. So can Objects.
