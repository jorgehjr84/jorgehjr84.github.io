## JavaScript Basics

    Null - This basically means no object value is present.
    Boolen - A boolen is data that can only be "True" or "False"
    Number - Number is a numeric data type.
    String - A string is characters used to represent text.


###Special Constants

    Infinity - This is the numeric value that represents infinity.
    Nan - this is numeric data which is undefined or a value that cannot be represented.
    Undefined - A variable which has not been assigned a value.

###Basic Operators

    `+` This is the addition operator for adding numeric values
    `-`This is the subtraction operator for subtraction numeric values.
    `/` This is the division operator used to divide numeric values.

###More JavaScript!! :grimacing:

    variables - A variable is a named location where you can store value. That way you don't always have to type long lines of code.+ ex. var myName = Jorge; 
    Functions -  A function is a procedure that calculates value or performs a task.
    

    For Loops - This is an easy way to keep repeating something. Instead of typing the same code over and over, you can just put it in a loop.
    For Loop - This is a loop that keeps repeating until a value is False.
    While Loop - This is a cleaner way of writing a loop. Below is an example of a for loop and a while loop
    - for (var i; i < 10; i++);
    - while ( i < 10)


    if Else Statements - This lets you perform a task IF the statement is TRUE, if the statement is not true (else) perform task B.
