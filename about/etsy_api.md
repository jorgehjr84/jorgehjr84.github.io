    * [ ] How can I ask for more (or less) data from a request?
    * In the url you can set the offset to see the number of data results you want to see within the limits listed above. It looks like this.
 ```

 ```
    * [ ] How do I know that there is more data available?
There is a count field that will tell you how many results are available.
