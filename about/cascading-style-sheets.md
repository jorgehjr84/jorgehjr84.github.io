## Display property

* Block
```
'div' is the standard block-level element. A block-level element starts on a new line and stretches out to left and right as far as it can.
```

* Inline
```
'span' is the standard inline element. An inline element can wrap some text inside a paragraph.
```

*max-width
``` 
This will improve the browsers handling of small windows. This is important to make content suitable for mobile.
```

*box-sizing
```
When you set box sizing on an element, the padding and border of that element no longer increases its width.
```



* Position property
``` 
Static , Relative, Fixed, and Absolute are all position properties. 
Static - Static is the default. An element with a static position is not positioned in any special way.
Relative - Relative behaves just like static unless you feed it some properties. Setting top, right, bottom, and left positions will cause the element to be positioned differently from its normal postion.```
Fixed - This will give an element a fixed position. So if you scroll down, that element will stay in the same position as you scroll.
Absolute - Absolute behaves like fixed except relative to the nearest positioned ancestor instead of relative to the viewport. ```

* Float property 
``
Float is used to wrap text around images.
```

* Clearfix
```
If an image is larger than it's element, this is a way to fix it. Using clearfix will adjust the image to the size of its element.
ex. .clearfix {
  overflow: auto;
}

```


##Font Properties

```
font-style, font-variant, font-weight, font-stretch, font-size, line-height, font-family.

* font-style: (inital value normal) font-style lets you chose between italic, oblique, and inherit font-styles.
* font-variant: font-variant sets the font variant that will be used for the text content of an element. (from sitepoint) I don't yet understand font-variants.
* font-weight: This specifies the font-weight or boldness or the text.
* font-stretch: This is a way to adjust the fonts width for a lack of a better description. 
* font-size: This is how you can change the size of font in your document.
* line-height: on block level elements, line-height specifies the minimum height of the box.
* font-family: This lets you specifiy the list of font- families for your CSS doc.
```
