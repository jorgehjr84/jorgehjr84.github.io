## Display property

* Block
```'div' is the standard block-level element. A block-level element starts on a new line and stretches out to left and right as far as it can.```

* Inline
```'span' is the standard inline element. An inline element can wrap some text inside a paragraph.

*max-width
``` This will improve the browsers handling of small windows. This is important to make content suitable for mobile.```

*box-sizing
```When you set box sizing on an element, the padding and border of that element no longer increases its width.```



* Position property
```Static , Relative, Fixed, and Absolute are all position properties. 
Static - Static is the default. An element with a static position is not positioned in any special way.
Relative - Relative behaves just like static unless you feed it some properties. Setting top, right, bottom, and left positions will cause the element to be positioned differently from its normal postion.```
Fixed - This will give an element a fixed position. So if you scroll down, that element will stay in the same position as you scroll.
Absolute - Absolute behaves like fixed except relative to the nearest positioned ancestor instead of relative to the viewport.```

* Float property 
```Float is used to wrap text around images.```

* Clearfix
```If an image is larger than it's element, this is a way to fix it. Using clearfix will adjust the image to the size of its element.
ex. .clearfix {
  overflow: auto;
}

```




* Responsive Design  
```The strategy of making a site respond to the browser and device thats using it.```
