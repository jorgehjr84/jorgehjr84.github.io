```



* Position property
``` 
Static , Relative, Fixed, and Absolute are all position properties. 
Static - Static is the default. An element with a static position is not positioned in any special way.
Relative - Relative behaves just like static unless you feed it some properties. Setting top, right, bottom, and left positions will cause the element to be positioned differently from its normal postion.```
Fixed - This will give an element a fixed position. So if you scroll down, that element will stay in the same position as you scroll.
Absolute - Absolute behaves like fixed except relative to the nearest positioned ancestor instead of relative to the viewport. ```

* Float property 
``
Float is used to wrap text around images.
```

* Clearfix
```
If an image is larger than it's element, this is a way to fix it. Using clearfix will adjust the image to the size of its element.
ex. .clearfix {
  overflow: auto;
}

```
