# DOM - Document Object Model

 * The `DOM` or document object model is a programming interface for HTML, XML, and SVG documents. The `DOM` provides another way to represent, store, and manipulate a webpage.
 

### The Window Object

   - The `window.location` read only property returns a `Location` object with information about the current location of the document.

   


   - The `window.document` returns a refernce to the document contained in a window.
syntax ```doc = window.document ```

   


   - The `window.history` returns a reference to the `History` object.
syntax ```var historyObj = window.history;```
