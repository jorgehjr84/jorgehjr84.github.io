# DOM - Document Object Model

 * The `DOM` or document object model is a programming interface for HTML, XML, and SVG documents. The `DOM` provides another way to represent, store, and manipulate a webpage.
 

### The Window Object

  * The window object represents a window that contains the `DOM` document. A window for a given document can be obtained using the document.defaultView property.


   - The window.location read only property returns a `Location` object with information about the current location of the document.
