## HTML



### Tags

* Tags are hidden keywords within a web page that define how the browswer must format and display the content. Most tags have two
parts, an opening tag and a closing tag. For example

```
<p> </p>
```

The basic structure of this opening tag is angled brackets```< >``` with your keyword inside those angle brackets. Then whatever
your  content is goes after the opening tag and when you are done you would use a closing tag. The closing tag is very similar
to the opening tag but with a "/". So it looks like ```</>```.
When you enter the opening tag you are telling the document you are starting a command. When you enter the closing tag, you are telling
the document you are done with your command.

I used the "p" keyword in my example which stands for paragraph. So if I wanted to write a paragraph in 
HTML it would look like this....

```
<p>
    This is just an example of a paragraph I wanted to write in HTML. 
    That's all I wanted to say."
</p>
```

There are some "non-word" elements in tags. We already spoke about the angled brackets "< >", but there is also 
the " = " that is used. 
The " ! " also shows up in certain tags.
" ... " is another that I have seen.

Here are some common tags used....



```
<!doctype html>
* This doctype declaration is not an HTML tag, but it is just as important. It is an instruction to the web browser about what
version of the markup language the page is written in.
```
next is ...

```
<html class="no-js" lang="">
*  This tells the HTML document what class we need to use for the JS..... ( I need to look into this concept more)
```
