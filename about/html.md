## HTML



### Tags

* Tags are hidden keywords within a web page that define how the browswer must format and display the content. Most tags have two
parts, an opening tag and a closing tag. For example

```
<p> </p>
```

The basic structure of this opening tag is angled brackets```< >``` with your keyword inside those angle brackets. Then whatever
your  content is goes after the opening tag and when you are done you would use a closing tag. The closing tag is very similar
to the opening tag but with a "/". So it looks like ```</>```.
When you enter the opening tag you are telling the document you are starting a command. When you enter the closing tag, you are telling
the document you are done with your command.

I used the "p" keyword in my example which stands for paragraph. So if I wanted to write a paragraph in 
HTML it would look like this....

```
<p>
    This is just an example of a paragraph I wanted to write in HTML. 
    That's all I wanted to say."
</p>
```

There are some "non-word" elements in tags. We already spoke about the angled brackets "< >", but there is also 
the " = " that is used. 
The " ! " also shows up in certain tags.
" ... " is another that I have seen.

Here are some common tags used....
