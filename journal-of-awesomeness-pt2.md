After two weeks at TIY, I have learned to cope with all of the ups and downs we have encountered thus far. I have always been successful at whatever it was I decided to put my mind to, so going through so many failures at TIY was difficult for me. Now that I have gone through two weeks of the program, I am learning that failure is just part of the process. It has been extremely humbling, but when you go through these failures and find the solutions to them one by one, it can be one of the most gratifying feelings ever. I am still struggling with finding the balance between working on code, and I guess what I would call personal time. It is natural to want to finish every assignment, and to hone in on an obstacle until you complete it. There are times that continuing to work can be counterproductive though. What I have been doing now is work until I can't figure something out, play with my son for 20mins, and then come back to that same issue. It has worked wonders for my development. I love how the expericances at TIY is also giving us an idea of how to judge scope. Here are a few of the highlights of week 2 in my opinion.....


  * MVC
```
Model - How do I write something in Javascript
Controller - When user interacts with the 'view' 'controller' tells the 'model' what to do.
View- Interface to view this thing.

```

  *The importance of User Stories
```
The importance of user stories is extremely high. The user stories not only let you judge scope, but they help you code from both perspectives( outside in/ inside out)
  ```
  
  *Developer Tools in a browser
``` 
One of the funnest tools we learned how to use in week 2 was the developer tools. Basically you can inspect any website's elements, functions, and files from the developer tools view in your browser.

```
 *The link between JavaScript, HTML, and CSS
```
Coming to TIY I did not really have a full understanding of the link between HTML, CSS, and JS. After week 2 I have learned the importance of each. They all have their roles to play. Linking them together is a vital step in building the web application, and that is something we have also learned in week 2.
