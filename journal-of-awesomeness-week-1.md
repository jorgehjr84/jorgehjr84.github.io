## Week 1 at TIY what a Roller Coaster

After one week at TIY, it has been a roller coaster, one minute you feel good about where you are at in the process, the next,
you are totally drowning in information. It has been a humbling experiance and has also taught me a lot about myself as a person.
To the say the course is difficult is an understatement. I have worked at many tech convections in the past, filled with 
developers and I would hear them say you have to think like an enigneer. I never know what they meant, but now that I have been 
at TIY for a week, I think I know exactly what they meant. This has been a learning experiance like none I've ever been through 
before. You have to think outside of the box and come at problems from multiple angels. You also have to be able to find a lot of
the questions to your answers from various sources. So you learn how to be very resourceful. Although the course has been 
stressful at times, it has been developed in a genius way. TIY takes you out of your comfort zone and helps you surprise 
yourself everyday. It can be an emotional roller coaster where you feel great, then you feel dumb, then you feel great again, 
only to be knocked back down to reality. These ups and downs usually happen multiple times within the hour. Here are some 
of my favorite takeaways from week one....

 * Have a Growth Mindset
Having a growth mindset can have a drastic impact on how we learn. It is based on the theory that the harder we work at 
something, the better or smarter we will get at it. It's a huge confidence booster.

  * What do developers do?
Developers make applications to make task easier.

  * Inputs, Outputs, Side Effects
This is something essential remember. You must always ask what will the "Inputs, Outputs, and Side Effects" be when you are creating something. Whether it be a function, object, or anything.

  * We learned about "User Stories"
A someone can do something, so that someone else can benefit.


  * The web is run by Linux

  * Github
  * Navigating through Github and workflow best practices.
 
  * Comand Line, Comand Line, Comand Line
This has probably been my favorite aspect of week one. We have learned to do some much through the command line. It has
opened up a new world for us, and it feels like knowing how to perform functions through the command line is almost like  
some super power we never knew we had.
