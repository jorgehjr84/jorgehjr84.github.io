### The Noun Project
https://thenounproject.com/

- The Noun Project is an awesome website that you can go to for a library of free icons. You can use the icons in your code to make
the icons show up in elements in your website. I used it a lot over these past few weeks for everything from an arrow, to a 
chess piece.
