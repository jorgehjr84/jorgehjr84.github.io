Week 2 at TIY Learning to cope with the ups and downs

After two weeks at TIY, I have learned to cope with all of the ups and downs we have encountered thus far. I have always been successful at whatever it was I decided to put my mind to, so going through so many failures at TIY was difficult for me. Now that I have gone through two weeks of the program, I am learning that failure is just part of the process. It has been extremely humbling, but when you go through these failures and find the solutions to them one by one, it can be one of the most gratifying feelings ever. I am still struggling with finding the balance between working on code, and I guess what I would call personal time. It is natural to want to finish every assignment, and to hone in on an obstacle until you complete it. There are times that continuing to work can be counterproductive though. What I have been doing now is work until I can't figure something out, play with my son for 20mins, and then come back to that same issue. It has worked wonders for my development. I love how the expericances at TIY is also giving us an idea of how to judge scope. Here are a few of the highlights of week 2 in my opinion.....



- MVC

- The importance of User Stories

- Developer Tools in a browser

- Event Listeners

- The link between JavaScript, HTML, and CSS
