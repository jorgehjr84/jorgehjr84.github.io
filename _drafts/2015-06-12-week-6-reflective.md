### Week 6 at TIY

Week 6 was a diffucult week but an exciting. We were introduced to APIs in week 6. Which being able to work with APIs as a 
developer is an extremely powerful tool. When thinking of what APIs are and trying to explain it to my wife, I find that the 
easiest way to describe APIs is by saying, ' it is a way for one program to talk to another program.' So say I have a website and
I want people to be able to login to my site via Facebook. So I would need the Facebook API in order for people to be able to log
in to my site. 
I also learned during week 6 that all APIs are not created equal. Some are much easier to work with and better documented than others.
The weekend assignment was my favorite aspect of week 6. The assignment was called 'make something beautiful,' and was pretty much
am open assignment. So we were able to create whatever we wanted as long as we worked with 2 APIs. We were also allowed to do this
project with a partner and it definitely helped in planning and communicating for a project. In the end we got 3 APIs working. 
We created a site that was like a morning dashboard that included some photos from flickr(API1), the weather from NY(API2),
and the top 4 NY Times headlines.(API4).
