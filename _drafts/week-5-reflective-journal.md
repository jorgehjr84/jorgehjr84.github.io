### WE WERE HOODWINKED !!!!

Week 5 was our half time week and so far it has been my favorite week here at TIY. It was definitely not what I expected when I 
heard we were going to have a half time week. Originally I thought maybe we would just work on some random things we had issues with
over the past few weeks, but that was not the case. 

First day of review week we were assigned a 'week-long' project. The project entailed us creating our own site that we would use 
later as our webiste for our blogs. This was an awesome assignment because it really brought together everything we had learned, 
as well as forced us to do some major planning on the front end. It almost felt as though this assignment was a prequel to our final
project. In order for us to accomplish creating our blog site we had to pull together everything we knew about HTML, CSS, and
Javascript. It was one of those instances where you don't know what you don't know until you dive in. At the same time, it was 
pretty incredible how much we did know after just 4 weeks of touching this stuff.

One of the things we also learned about during review week was scope. This 'week-long' project was actually a pretty massive undertaking
and some of us definitely underestimated what was needed to get the site up. 

Lastly, and the reason I titled this journal entry "We were HOODWINKED," is because we were originally lead to believe we had an
entire week to complete the full site. On Thursday however, we were told we had a completely different assignment for the weekend.
So we did not get nearly as much done as we wanted to. With that being said I look forward to revisiting that project further down 
the road. It was hard to let it go for now, but it is good experience about letting go of a project.
