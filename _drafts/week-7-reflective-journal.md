### Week 7 

I know I say this every week, but week 7 has definitely been the most challenging thus far. It was really difficult to stay 
motivated through week 7. I am not sure if we were just burned out, or whether or not the tools we were introduced to this week 
were not as exciting as say working with APIs. We also had another group project, which was a three person project and that was 
extremely hard. My two partners on my team were awesome, but working with people in general can be a challenge. Throw coding into
the mix and it can be a down right nightmare. As a team we did not communicate like we should have, and our progress reflected
that. We also rotated the role of team lead each day, and the lead could not code. Since my other two team members are much more passive 
than me, I had to make a conscious effort to not influence them too much when they were team leads. I wanted them to come up with
their own plan of attack each day they were team leader. It was definitely an eye opener as to how a team should be run, and we are
definitely not there yet. But we are getting there.
