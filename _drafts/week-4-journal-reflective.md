### Week 4 Reflective Journal

  Where to begin?? Week 4 was the most challenging week thus far. I usually like to include technical aspects to my journal entries,
and discuss some key principles that I have learned, but I decided for my week 4 journal to forego that. Week 4 was all about
emotions and adversity in my opinion. So here goes....

On Monday of week 4 we were off due to a holiday, and I felt like as a result the whole week was as though we were playing 
catch up. We were planning on doing a 'review week' for week 5, so we tried to cram a ton of info in just before review week. Week
4's pace was fast and unforgiving. It was a week where the stronger members of our group barely stayed a float (maybe they were
just faking it) and some of the less technical students fell further behind. As a result, it was frustrating for everyone, including
our instructor and I don't blame him. I'm actually surprised they don't get more frustrated with us over at TIY. I feel like I 
developed a new respect for what TIY and our instructor are trying to do. It's honestly nothing short of a miracle. Take a group 
of individuals with no experience, and give them so much knowledge about a very difficult craft(coding) in 3mos, that
they can stand shoulder to shoulder with other job applicants out there in the field. I try to think of something else that would
be comparable and I can't.

  I learned a lot about my peers in week 4 and learned even more about myself. I was told in the interview process that this time
at TIY would be mentally challenging, but I don't think I was fully prepared for it. When I was told that it would be challenging,
I didn't really flinch because I came from a place where high stress was just part of the job. I have always been calm and cool
under pressure, but I actually had a breakdown during week 4. I have been so accustomed to success in whatever I set
my mind to, that when I kept coming up short on assignments, I did not know how to deal with it. I was so frustrated at myself that
I was pretty cranky for a couple of days in a row. Yes I could handle stress and think on my feet, but what I wasn't prepared for 
was the constant fear of failing or falling behind(4 weeks worth).  

 Luckily for me, I have a good support system at home. If anyone wonders on whether or not they want to do something like this, a
good support system at home is crucial. You are going to fail, you are going to fall behind, and you have to learn how to cope 
with that and keep pushing through. Maintaining a good attitude is really difficult, but you just take it day by day. Even with all
of the hard work I have put in, the stressful days, and the long hours I have loved the process. I am continuing to surprise
myself on a day to day basis. It is incredible how far we have come in 4 weeks, and I have been learning so much about myself.
I am sure over the remainder of the program there will still be plenty of up's and down's, but I can't wait for whats next to see
how I can surprise myself further.
