### How to curl API info

So basically when you are using an API one of the things you can do is request data from that API. For example if you want to 
get info from NY Times, you have to put in a request for that data. To do this you use the curl command. You have to go to 
the site's whose API you want and find the URL for the information you are trying to get. So this is what the command looks like


```
curl http://api.nytimes.com/svc/news/v3/content/nyt/U.S./24.json?

```

This makes a request to the NY times for their data and request that the NY times sends the data back via a JSON file. The data 
comes back looking something like this


```
